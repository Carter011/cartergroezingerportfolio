# About Me

I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with a concentration in Robotics and Automation. My academic and professional experiences span computational modeling, system integration, and industrial automation, allowing me to work comfortably across theory-driven and application-driven engineering problems.

Through research with the Multiscale Advection Diffusion Analysis Laboratory (MADAL), I have developed and applied high-performance computational tools to study complex fluid systems. In parallel, my work on the EcoCAR EV Challenge and at Cardinal Health has given me hands-on experience integrating, testing, and validating real world engineering systems.

Outside the classroom and lab, I am a member of the NCAA Division II Men’s Lacrosse team at Embry-Riddle. Balancing athletics with engineering has strengthened my time management, teamwork, and ability to perform under pressure.
