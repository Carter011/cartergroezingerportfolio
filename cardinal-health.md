# Cardinal Health – Robotic Automation Engineering

## Project Overview
This project involved supporting the development, integration, and validation of robotic automation systems in a manufacturing environment at Cardinal Health. The work focused on automating material handling operations, integrating industrial robots with custom tooling, and supporting system verification prior to deployment.

The role combined software development, mechanical design, and system-level testing in a production-focused setting.

## Engineering Context
Cardinal Health operates high-throughput manufacturing facilities where automation reliability, repeatability, and safety are critical. Robotic systems must meet strict operational requirements before being approved for production use.

My work supported the automation engineering team in developing and validating robotic solutions intended to reduce manual labor, improve consistency, and increase manufacturing efficiency.

## My Role
I worked as an **Automation Engineering Intern**, supporting both development and testing activities. My responsibilities included:

- Programming and operating robotic systems  
- Designing and validating custom robotic tooling  
- Developing supporting software for robot integration  
- Assisting with system-level testing and verification  

---

## Robotic System Development
Key development activities included:

- Programming robotic systems using **ROS2 (Python/C++)**  
- Designing specialized end-effectors and tooling for high-precision pick-and-place operations  
- Integrating **Universal Robots (UR)** arms into automated work cells  
- Developing a custom **URCap** in Java to enhance system interoperability and user interaction  

These efforts supported flexible automation solutions adaptable to different manufacturing tasks.

---

## Testing and Validation (Factory Acceptance Testing)
A critical component of the role was supporting **Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)** prior to system deployment.

During FAT, I:
- Executed test procedures to verify robotic system functionality  
- Checked system behavior against defined operational requirements  
- Assisted in identifying and resolving hardware and software discrepancies  
- Documented test results to support acceptance decisions  

This process ensured that systems met performance, safety, and reliability expectations before entering production.
