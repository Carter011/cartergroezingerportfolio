# MADAL – Computational Hemodynamics

## Role
Research Assistant – Multiscale Advection Diffusion Analysis Laboratory (MADAL)

## Work Summary
- Developed patient-specific simulations of renal artery blood flow using Lattice Boltzmann hemodynamic modeling
- Analyzed vessel geometry and flow disturbances to evaluate surgical maneuvers and stent placement guidance
- Collaborated with researchers to translate computational findings into actionable clinical insight

## Tools
MATLAB, simulation workflows, analysis/visualization, technical documentation
